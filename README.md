## Acknowledgments

I want to thank StackOverflow as they helped me to solve mostly all the errors I encountered making this project and Bootstrap for the designing part.
Also please wait after searching the city name. It will show details after some time. The reason is that I am using a free version of Rapid API, so fetching the details is limited. Also, Weather for other cities under this section will show "undefined" sometimes so bear with it. Thank You!
